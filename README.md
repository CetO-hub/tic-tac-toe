# tic-tac-toe

Problem

An exercise to practice the skills in factory functions and module pattern to write a better organized code.
For this purpose a tic-tac-toe game where you can set X's and the opponent O's (or vice versa) on a 3x3 game-board will be created. The first one with 3 in a row/column or diagonal wins. Else it is a tie.

Plan

The UI should allow the player's to input the names and choose X or O. X begins the game. The player turn alternate after each X or O set. When there is no place left and no 3 X's or O's in a row/column or diagonal were archived then the game should show that it is a tie. As soon as one player has the above mentioned combination of 3 the winner should be displayed. A start/restart button should be available with the respective function.
A possibility to play with the computer should also be included choosing from 3 different difficulties.
